<objective>
Build the LogViewer page with filtering and search, wire up the build integration, and verify the complete dashboard visually.

Purpose: The LogViewer is the final page completing the 4-page SPA. Build integration ensures the dashboard ships as pre-built static files in the npm package (FNDN-05). The visual verification confirms the entire dashboard works end-to-end.
Output: Complete 4-page dashboard SPA that builds and can be served by the Express server.

  <name>Task 1: Build LogViewer page with phase/step filtering and search</name>
  <files>
    autopilot/dashboard/src/pages/LogViewer.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**LogViewer.tsx (DASH-18):**

Full-page log viewer with filtering, search, and auto-scroll. This is a more capable version of the LogStream component used in the overview -- it gets its own page with dedicated controls.

1. **Log data:** Subscribe to `useDashboardStore(s => s.logs)` for the full log array.

2. **Filter controls (top toolbar):**
   - **Phase filter:** A select dropdown listing unique phase numbers from the logs, plus "All phases" option. When selected, only show logs matching that phase number.
   - **Step filter:** A select dropdown listing unique step values from the logs, plus "All steps" option. Filter by step.
   - **Search:** A text input with placeholder "Search logs..." that filters log entries by message content (case-insensitive substring match). Use a local `searchTerm` state with onChange -- no debounce needed since filtering is client-side over max 500 entries.
   - **Clear filters** button that resets all filters

3. **Filtered logs:** Apply all active filters (phase AND step AND search) to produce the displayed log list. Use `useMemo` with dependencies on [logs, phaseFilter, stepFilter, searchTerm] to avoid recomputing on every render.

4. **Log display:** Reuse the same auto-scroll pattern from LogStream (Pattern 6 from research):
   - useRef on container div, useState for autoScroll (default true)
   - useEffect to scroll to bottom when filtered logs length changes and autoScroll is true
   - onScroll handler to detect manual scroll-up
   - Each log line: timestamp (HH:MM:SS), level badge (colored), [component], message
   - Color-code by level: debug=gray, info=default, warn=amber, error=red, fatal=red bold

5. **Stats bar:** Below the filters, show: total log count, filtered count (if filtering), and auto-scroll toggle button ("Auto-scroll: ON/OFF" that toggles the autoScroll state manually).

6. **Empty state:** If no logs at all, show "No log entries yet. Logs will appear here as the build runs."

Tailwind layout:
- Full height page: flex flex-col h-[calc(100vh-4rem)] (subtract header height)
- Filter toolbar: flex gap-3 items-center p-4 bg-white border-b
- Log container: flex-1 overflow-y-auto bg-gray-950 text-gray-300 font-mono text-xs p-4
- Stats bar: flex justify-between px-4 py-2 bg-gray-100 text-sm text-gray-600

  <name>Task 2: Wire build integration for npm distribution</name>
  <files>
    autopilot/package.json
  </files>
  <action>
Update `autopilot/package.json` to include dashboard build in the parent build pipeline.

1. **Add build scripts:**
   - Add `"build:dashboard": "cd dashboard && npm install && npm run build"` script
   - Update the existing `"build"` script to: `"tsc && cd dashboard && npm install && npm run build"`
   This ensures `npm run build` at the autopilot root produces both the server dist/ and dashboard/dist/.

2. **Verify existing files array:** The `"files"` array already contains `"dashboard/dist/"` (confirmed from package.json). No change needed here.

3. **Run the full build:**
   - Run `cd autopilot && npm run build` to verify the complete build pipeline works
   - Confirm `autopilot/dashboard/dist/index.html` exists after build
   - Confirm `autopilot/dist/` contains the compiled server TypeScript

4. **Update App.tsx:** Remove the placeholder components for QuestionResponse, PhaseDetail, and LogViewer that were created in Plan 02 (they should now import from the real page files created in Plans 02, 03, and 04). Update imports to:
   - `import { Overview } from './pages/Overview'`
   - `import { QuestionResponse } from './pages/QuestionResponse'`
   - `import { PhaseDetail } from './pages/PhaseDetail'`
   - `import { LogViewer } from './pages/LogViewer'`

Note: If App.tsx already imports from real page files (Plan 02 may have wired them), verify they are correct and skip this step.

  <verify>
Run `cd autopilot && npm run build` -- completes successfully.
Verify `autopilot/dashboard/dist/index.html` exists.
Run `cd autopilot && npm test` -- existing server tests still pass.
  </verify>
  <done>Parent build script produces both server dist/ and dashboard dist/. The dashboard/dist/ directory is ready to be served by ResponseServer's SPA fallback. Existing tests unaffected.</done>

  <name>Task 3: Visual verification of complete dashboard</name>
  <files>autopilot/dashboard/src</files>
  <action>
Start the dashboard dev server and verify all 4 pages render correctly.

What was built: Complete 4-page React dashboard SPA with real-time SSE updates, question response flow, phase detail views, and log viewer with filtering. Built with React 19, Vite 7, Zustand 5, Tailwind CSS v4, and React Router 7.

How to verify:
1. Start the dashboard dev server: `cd autopilot/dashboard && npm run dev`
2. The dev server runs on http://localhost:5173 (requires the Express API on port 3847 for data, but the UI structure can be verified without it)

Verify each page:
- **Overview (/)**: Progress bar, phase card section, question badge, activity feed, collapsible log stream. Responsive layout (resize browser to see mobile single-column).
- **Question Response (/questions/test-id)**: Should show "Question not found" since no real questions exist -- this is correct behavior. Verify the page loads without errors.
- **Phase Detail (/phases/1)**: Should show "Phase not found" or empty state since no real data exists. Verify the page loads without errors.
- **Log Viewer (/logs)**: Should show empty state "No log entries yet". Verify filter dropdowns and search input render. Verify auto-scroll toggle button exists.

Check navigation:
- Header shows "GSD Autopilot" with connection indicator (red dot expected since no server)
- Nav links work: clicking "Overview" and "Logs" navigates correctly
- Browser back/forward buttons work

3. Verify production build: `cd autopilot/dashboard && npm run build` produces dist/index.html

Resume signal: Type "approved" if the dashboard looks correct, or describe any visual/functional issues.
  </action>
  <verify>User visually confirms all 4 pages render correctly, navigation works, and empty states display properly.</verify>
  <done>Dashboard passes visual verification -- all pages render, navigation works, empty states display correctly, and production build succeeds.</done>
</task>

- `cd autopilot/dashboard && npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
- `cd autopilot/dashboard && npx vite build` produces dist/ with index.html + JS/CSS
- `cd autopilot && npm run build` completes the full build pipeline
- All 4 pages render without errors
- LogViewer has phase filter, step filter, text search, and auto-scroll
- Build integration produces dashboard/dist/ ready for Express serving

<success_criteria>
Complete 4-page dashboard SPA builds successfully, serves from Express via SPA fallback, and passes visual verification. All DASH requirements (10-18) and FNDN-05 are satisfied.
