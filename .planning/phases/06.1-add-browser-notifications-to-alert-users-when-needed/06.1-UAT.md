awaiting: user response

## Tests

### 1. Notification Controls in Header
expected: Open the dashboard in your browser. In the header navigation bar (after the "Logs" link), you should see a subtle "Enable notifications" link in small gray text.
result: [pending]

### 2. Notification Permission Soft-Ask Flow
expected: Click the "Enable notifications" link. Your browser should show its native notification permission prompt (not an aggressive auto-prompt on page load). If you grant permission, the link should change to a "Notifications" dropdown.
result: [pending]

### 3. Per-Type Notification Toggles
expected: After granting permission, click the "Notifications" dropdown. You should see four checkboxes: Questions (on), Errors (on), Phase completed (off), Build complete (on). Toggling them should persist across page refresh.
result: [pending]

### 4. PWA Installable
expected: The browser should show a PWA install prompt or option (e.g., install icon in address bar). The app name should be "GSD Autopilot Dashboard" with a dark gray icon.
result: [pending]

### 5. Browser Badge Count
expected: When there are pending questions, the browser tab or PWA badge should show the count of pending questions. When questions are answered, the badge count should decrease.
result: [pending]

### 6. Notification Sound on New Question
expected: With the dashboard open in a visible tab and notification preferences enabled for questions, when a new question arrives (via SSE), a short notification sound should play at moderate volume.
result: [pending]

### 7. Push Notification When Dashboard Closed
expected: Close or minimize the dashboard tab. When a new question or error event occurs, a browser push notification should appear with "GSD Autopilot: " prefix in the title and relevant details in the body.
result: [pending]

### 8. Notification Click Navigation
expected: When you receive a push notification and click on it, the dashboard should open (or focus if already open) and navigate to the relevant page -- questions page for question notifications, phases page for errors, home for build/phase completion.
result: [pending]
