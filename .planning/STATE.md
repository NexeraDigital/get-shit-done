# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Turn a PRD document into a fully built project by running one command, with human decisions collected asynchronously through notifications instead of synchronous CLI prompts.
**Current focus:** Phase 11 - Use Microsoft dev-tunnels for remote dashboard access

## Current Position

Phase: 11 of 13 (Use Microsoft dev-tunnels to create public URLs for remote dashboard access)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase -- COMPLETE
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-02-25 -- Completed 11-03 Surface tunnel URL in dashboard UI and notifications (7 files modified)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Claude Agent SDK replaces `claude -p` child process spawning (from research)
- [Roadmap]: Node.js >= 20 target (Node 18 is EOL per research)
- [Roadmap]: 7-phase structure derived from requirement categories and dependency order
- [01-01]: All type exports use export type for verbatimModuleSyntax; only Zod schema is runtime export
- [01-01]: Autopilot package lives in autopilot/ subdirectory alongside existing get-shit-done-cc root
- [01-02]: Zod schema duplicates type structure with literal enums for self-contained runtime validation
- [01-02]: getState returns shallow copy for immutability; private constructor with static factory methods
- [01-03]: safeParse used for config validation (user-facing input) with field-level error formatting
- [01-03]: Env var coercion: "true"/"false" to boolean, numeric strings to number, else string passthrough
- [01-04]: Ring buffer population in log() method, not pino stream pipeline -- synchronous and avoids multistream performance concerns
- [01-04]: SonicBoom flush uses ready-then-flushSync pattern to handle async destination readiness
- [02-01]: export type for all Claude types (consistent with verbatimModuleSyntax)
- [02-01]: ES2024 lib in tsconfig instead of global type declaration for Promise.withResolvers
- [02-01]: timer.unref() in createTimeout prevents vitest hangs and Node process exit issues
- [02-02]: SDKResultLike local interface for duck-typing instead of SDK import (avoids runtime side effects)
- [02-02]: Three-branch parsing: success, is_error override, error subtypes (explicit over DRY)
- [02-03]: Locally-defined SDK interfaces (AskUserQuestionInput, PermissionResultAllow) to keep tests SDK-free
- [02-03]: HandleQuestionOptions as separate parameter for phase/step metadata
- [02-03]: Conditional spread for optional phase/step fields to keep QuestionEvent clean
- [02-04]: Double-cast through unknown for SDK input types in canUseTool (strict mode)
- [02-04]: vi.mock with async generator factories for testing SDK query() without process spawning
- [02-04]: AbortError name-check for timeout detection (matches SDK abort behavior)
- [03-01]: Injectable exit function in ShutdownManager.install() for testability (default: process.exit)
- [03-01]: YOLO config uses spread merge ({...existing, ...yoloSettings}) preserving user keys not in override set
- [03-01]: Invalid JSON in existing config.json treated as empty object (YOLO settings take priority)
- [03-02]: Pure function separation: generateSkipDiscussContext returns string, writeSkipDiscussContext adds I/O
- [03-02]: ENOENT means passed -- missing verification/UAT files assume phase passed (no false gap detection)
- [03-02]: vi.useFakeTimers() for Date mocking in vitest (vi.spyOn(Date) breaks constructors)
- [03-03]: extractPhasesFromContent as pure function accepting content string for testability
- [03-03]: ShutdownError custom error class to distinguish shutdown aborts from real errors
- [03-03]: Phase 3 escalation defaults to abort (throw) since web UI is Phase 4

- [03-04]: Commander.js v14 installed (ESM-native, async action support via parseAsync)
- [03-04]: CLI validates --prd/--resume manually in action handler (not .requiredOption) for conditional requirement
- [03-04]: ShutdownManager wiring: logger flush + state persist handlers registered before orchestrator start
- [03.1-01]: Error results (is_error: true) bypass verbosity filter -- always visible in quiet mode
- [03.1-01]: Text delta stream events skipped in StreamLogger to prevent log bloat (Pitfall 3)
- [03.1-01]: Unicode box-drawing with ASCII fallback via WT_SESSION/TERM_PROGRAM detection
- [03.1-01]: Mock WritableOutput interface for testable stream output (not coupled to process.stdout)
- [03.1-02]: ClaudeService emits 'message' before session_id/result parsing -- all consumers see every message type
- [03.1-02]: StreamLogger flush registered before AutopilotLogger flush in ShutdownManager -- SDK logs flush first
- [03.1-02]: Orchestrator event listeners wired proactively (forward-compatible with future emit() calls)
- [03.1-02]: Spinner stopped before console.error in catch block to prevent garbled terminal output
- [04-01]: createServer() instead of app.listen() for reliable EADDRINUSE error handling on Windows

- [05-02]: Inline timeAgo helper instead of date-fns dependency for relative timestamp formatting
- [05-02]: LogStream auto-scroll uses scrollHeight-scrollTop-clientHeight threshold detection
- [05-03]: DASH-16 implemented as pre-submit editing (form freely editable before submit, disabled after)
- [05-03]: Freeform text overrides option selection when non-empty (merge priority on submit)
- [05-03]: LogStream component reused from Plan 02 for filtered phase logs
- [05-03]: PhaseCard STEP_ORDER fixed to const assertion to avoid PhaseStep union indexing error
- [05-04]: Express 5 path-to-regexp v8 requires named wildcards ({*path}) instead of bare * for SPA catchall

- [06-02]: loadCustomAdapter resolves paths relative to process.cwd() (not import.meta.url)
- [06-02]: loadCustomAdapter validates init/send/close methods before returning adapter
- [06-03]: NotificationManager constructor only takes questionReminderMs -- ConsoleAdapter receives port/stopSpinner directly
- [06-03]: Console adapter always added as fallback before channel-specific adapter switch
- [06-03]: notificationManager.close() called in success path, error path, and ShutdownManager LIFO registration
- [06-03]: build:complete has two listeners -- one for streamRenderer.stopSpinner(), one for notification dispatch (separate concerns)
- [07-01]: Preflight checks run in parallel via Promise.all, returning all failures at once (not one-at-a-time)
- [07-01]: parsePhaseRange returns sorted deduplicated number[] instead of {start, end} for non-contiguous range support
- [07-01]: Orchestrator.run() now accepts number[] and uses .includes() for phase filtering

- [08-02]: Status reads autopilot-state.json for phase progress and port from branches field
- [03.2-01]: extractDependsOn uses line-by-line parsing instead of complex regex for reliability
- [03.2-02]: Purple color scheme (bg-purple-100, text-purple-700) for INSERTED badge to visually distinguish from status badges

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 03.1 inserted after Phase 3: Display claude console output to parent node process so users can see whats happening (URGENT)
- Phase 8 added: Autopilot should be able to be executed by using a claude command
- Phase 06.1 inserted after Phase 6: add browser notifications to alert users when needed (URGENT)
- Phase 03.2 inserted after Phase 3: Add Sub phase support to orchestrator and dashboard (URGENT)
- Phase 9 added: Fix Recent activity so it persists in the .planning folder so it stays consistant and time works properly
- Phase 10 added: Add GSD Milestone support to autopilot and dashboard
- Phase 11 added: Use Microsoft dev-tunnels to create public URLs for remote dashboard access

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Agent SDK + GSD slash command integration is untested (needs validation in Phase 2)
- ~~`Promise.withResolvers` requires Node.js 22+ or polyfill for Node.js 20~~ RESOLVED: polyfill created in 02-01
